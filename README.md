# Dotfile Manager

#### This script will save all dotfiles and folders into a local directory to push to GitHub or any other service.

### How to Use:
1) #### Add all of your file and directory paths into the "*dotfiles.save*" file

    - All paths must begin from the root (i.e. ~/path/to/save)

2) #### Run the "*main.cpp*" script
    
    - Run: `g++ main.cpp && ./a.out`

3) #### Push the entire "dotfiles/" directory to GitHub or any other service

    - The "save/" directory will hold all of your dotfiles and folders

*Note: The "other/" directory can be used to save other miscellaneous files and directories.*
